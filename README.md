Lucie,

Your assignment is to change the logo at the top, change the button styling, and make at least one of the buttons link to a new page.

By Friday I want to decide on a name, logo, and a pleasant gender-neutral color profile. And I want to have the front page of the app and one other page done.

Call or email me if you get stuck. Also try looking on Stack Exchange and W3Schools.

P.S.

For the image to work, it needs to be saved in the same folder, e.g. Documents, as the html file.
